To use this:
1. install JAVA and Jason http://jason.sourceforge.net/mini-tutorial/getting-started/
3. open Jason and then open the vacuum.mas2j, robot.asl, av.asl and VCWorld.java
4. Agent plans are written in robot
5. the consequences of those plans are written in the VCWorld file which updates the graphical display.

Currently the AV drives north and the agent moves randomly. There is no end condition set yet.
